<p> Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.  The
signal/slot mechanism is a core technology of smooth and probably the
part that differs most from other toolkits. smooth is probably the only
object oriented toolkit that supports signals and slots without the need
of an additional preprocessor.
<p> In GUI programming we often want a change in one widget to be notified
to another widget. More generally, we want objects of any kind to be
able to communicate with one another. For example if we were parsing
an XML file we might want to notify a list view that we're using to
represent the XML file's structure whenever we encounter a new tag. 
<p> Older toolkits and older versions of smooth achieve this kind of
communication using callbacks. A
callback is a pointer to a function, so if you want a processing
function to notify you about some event you pass a pointer to another
function (the callback) to the processing function. The processing
function then calls the callback when appropriate. Callbacks have two
fundamental flaws. Firstly they are not type safe. We can never be
certain that the processing function will call the callback with the
correct arguments. Secondly the callback is strongly coupled to the
processing function since the processing function must know which
callback to call.
<p> <center><img src="callbacks.png"></center> <blockquote><p align="center"><em> Old-fashioned callbacks impair component programming
</em></p>
</blockquote><p> In smooth we have an alternative to the callback technique. We use signals
and slots. A signal is emitted when a particular event occurs. smooth's
widgets have many pre-defined signals, but we can always subclass to
add our own. A slot is a function that is called in reponse to a
particular signal. smooth's widgets have many pre-defined slots, but it is
common practice to add your own slots so that you can handle the
signals that you are interested in. 
<p> <center><img src="signals-and-slots.png"></center> <blockquote><p align="center"><em> Signals and Slots facilitate true type-safe component programming
</em></p>
</blockquote><p> The signals and slots mechanism is type safe: the signature of a
signal must match the signature of the receiving slot. (In fact a slot taking zero arguments can be connected to any signal because it can ignore extra arguments.) Since the signatures are compatible, the
compiler can help us detect type mismatches. Signals and slots are
loosely coupled: a class which emits a signal neither knows nor cares
which slots receive the signal. smooth's signals and slots mechanism
ensures that if you connect a signal to a slot, the slot will be
called with the signal's parameters at the right time. Signals and
slots can take up to eight arguments of any type (extending smooth for using signals with more arguments is easy, though). They are
completely typesafe: no more callback core dumps!
<p> smooth continues to support callbacks, though, but it implements them in a
typesafe manner. There are some cases where callbacks are more useful than
signals. If you want to be sure that only one function is connected to an event
or you want to receive a return value from a function, you probably want to
use callbacks rather than signals.
<p> All classes in smooth can contain signals and slots.  Signals are emitted by
objects when they change their state in a way that may be interesting
to the outside world.  This is all the object does to communicate. It
does not know or care whether anything is receiving the signals it
emits. This is true information encapsulation, and ensures that the
object can be used as a software component.
<p> Slots can be used for receiving signals, but they are normal member
functions. A slot does not know if it has any signals connected to
it. Again, the object does not know about the communication mechanism and
can be used as a true software component.
<p> You can connect as many signals as you want to a single slot, and a
signal can be connected to as many slots as you desire. It is even
possible to connect a signal directly to another signal.  (This will
emit the second signal immediately whenever the first is emitted.)
<p> Together, signals and slots make up a powerful component programming
mechanism.
<p> <h2> A Small Example
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> A minimal C++ class declaration might read:
<p> <pre>
    class Foo
    {
        public:
            Foo();
            int value() const { return val; }
            void setValue( int );
        private:
            int val;
    };
</pre>
 
<p> A small smooth class might read:
<p> <pre>
    class Foo
    {
        public:
            Foo();
            int value() const { return val; }
        slots:
            void setValue( int );
        signals:
            Signal1&lt;int&gt; valueChanged;
        private:
            int val;
    };
</pre>
 
<p> This class has the same internal state, and public methods to access the
state, but in addition it has support for component programming using
signals and slots: this class can tell the outside world that its state
has changed by emitting a signal, <tt>valueChanged()</tt>, and it has
a slot which other objects may send signals to.
<p> Slots are implemented by the application programmer.
Here is a possible implementation of Foo::setValue():
<p> <pre>
    void Foo::setValue( int v )
    {
        if ( v != val ) {
            val = v;
            valueChanged.Emit(v);
        }
    }
</pre>
 
<p> The line <tt>valueChanged.Emit(v)</tt> emits the signal
<tt>valueChanged</tt> from the object.  As you can see, you emit a
signal by using <tt>signal.Emit(arguments)</tt>.
<p> Here is one way to connect two of these objects together:
<p> <pre>
    Foo a, b;
    a.valueChanged.Connect(&Foo::setValue, &b);
    b.setValue( 11 ); // a == undefined  b == 11
    a.setValue( 79 ); // a == 79         b == 79
    b.value();        
</pre>
 
<p> Calling <tt>a.setValue(79)</tt> will make <tt>a</tt> emit a <tt>valueChanged()</tt>
signal, which <tt>b</tt> will receive in its <tt>setValue()</tt> slot,
i.e. <tt>b.setValue(79)</tt> is called. <tt>b</tt> will then, in turn,
emit the same <tt>valueChanged()</tt> signal, but since no slot has been
connected to <tt>b</tt>'s <tt>valueChanged()</tt> signal, nothing happens (the
signal disappears). 
<p> Note that the <tt>setValue()</tt> function sets the value and emits
the signal only if <tt>v != val</tt>. This prevents infinite looping
in the case of cyclic connections (e.g. if <tt>b.valueChanged()</tt>
were connected to <tt>a.setValue()</tt>).
<p> This example illustrates that objects can work together without knowing
each other, as long as there is someone around to set up a connection
between them initially.
<p> <h2> Signals
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> Signals are emitted by an object when its internal state has changed
in some way that might be interesting to the object's client or owner.
<p> A list box, for example, emits both <tt>onHighlightEntry</tt> and
<tt>onActivate</tt> signals.  Most objects will probably only be
interested in <tt>onActivate</tt> but some may want to know about
which item in the list box is currently highlighted.  If the signal is
interesting to two different objects you just connect the signal to
slots in both objects.
<p> When a signal is emitted, the slots connected to it are executed
immediately, just like a normal function call. The signal/slot
mechanism is totally independent of any GUI event loop. The
<tt>Emit()</tt> will return when all slots have returned.
<p> If several slots are connected to one signal, the slots will be
executed one after the other, in an arbitrary order, when the signal
is emitted.
<p> Signals can never have return types (i.e. Emit() never returns a value).
<p> <h2> Slots
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> A slot is called when a signal connected to it is emitted.  Slots are
normal C++ functions and can be called normally; signals can be connected to any function in smooth,
even normal C functions.
<p> Since slots are normal member functions, they have access rights like ordinary member functions.
<p> You can also define slots to be virtual, which we have found quite
useful in practice.
<p> The signals and slots mechanism is efficient, but not quite as fast as
"real" callbacks. Signals and slots are slightly slower because of the
increased flexibility they provide, although the difference for real
applications is insignificant. In general, emitting a signal that is
connected to some slots, is approximately ten times slower than calling
the receivers directly, with non-virtual function calls. This is the
overhead required to locate the connection object, to iterate
over all connections and to marshall any parameters in a
generic fashion. While ten non-virtual function calls may sound like a
lot, it's much less overhead than any 'new' or 'delete' operation, for
example. As soon as you perform a string, vector or list operation that
behind the scene requires 'new' or 'delete', the signals and slots
overhead is only responsible for a very small proportion of the complete
function call costs. The same is true whenever you do a system call in a
slot - or indirectly call more than ten functions. The
simplicity and flexibility of the signals and slots mechanism is well
worth the overhead, which your users won't even notice.
