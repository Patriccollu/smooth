The version number of a smooth release can be interpreted as follows:

In 'a.b.c.d' the 'a' is the major version number, the 'b' is the minor version number,
the 'c' is the release number (starting with 1) and the 'd' is the patchlevel (starting with 0).
So 0.8.13.4 means smooth version 0.8, 13th release, patchlevel 4 of version 0.8.
